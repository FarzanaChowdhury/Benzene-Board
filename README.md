## Demo

The goal of the game is to increase the player's own color by occupying the cells. When the player selects a cell, it will have two options - the color will be copied to the adjacent cell, or it will jump to one cell away.

If the color moves to a cell next to opponent's color, the opponent's cells will change into the player's color.

If a color lands on a yellow cell, player will either gain or lose two cells.

Whoever has occupied the highest number of cell will win.
